<div class="textblock"><p>This project is about decomposing a simple polygon into convex polygons by creating diagonals and using the <a class="el" href="class_d_c_e_l.html" title="A data structure that represents a planar subdivision of a 2D surface.">DCEL</a> data structure to store the polygon using the algorithm described in this <a href="https://github.com/bharathvariar/Polygon-Decomposition/blob/main/Algorithms%20for%20the%20decomposition%20of%20a%20polygon%20into%20convex.pdf">paper</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
1. Double-Connected Edge List (DCEL):</h1>
<p><a class="el" href="class_d_c_e_l.html" title="A data structure that represents a planar subdivision of a 2D surface.">DCEL</a> (Doubly Connected <a class="el" href="class_edge.html" title="Represents an edge in the DCEL data structure as a pair of half edges.">Edge</a> List) is a data structure commonly used to represent planar subdivisions of a 2D surface.</p>
<p>It stores information about the vertices, edges, and faces of the subdivision, along with their relationships to one another. Specifically, each vertex stores a pointer to an incident edge, each edge stores pointers to its incident vertices, its twin edge (if any), and the face on its right side, and each face stores a pointer to an incident edge on its boundary.</p>
<p><a class="el" href="class_d_c_e_l.html" title="A data structure that represents a planar subdivision of a 2D surface.">DCEL</a> is often used in computational geometry algorithms, such as computing Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
1.1 HalfEdge:</h2>
<p>A <a class="el" href="class_half_edge.html" title="Represents a directed edge in a polygon.">HalfEdge</a> stores information about one half of an edge in the polygon. Each edge in the polygon is represented by two <a class="el" href="class_half_edge.html" title="Represents a directed edge in a polygon.">HalfEdge</a> objects, one for each direction along the edge. The <a class="el" href="class_half_edge.html" title="Represents a directed edge in a polygon.">HalfEdge</a> class stores information about the vertex on which the edge is incident, the face on the right side of the edge, and pointers to the other half of the edge and its neighboring edges.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
1.2 Edge</h2>
<p>An edge in a <a class="el" href="class_d_c_e_l.html" title="A data structure that represents a planar subdivision of a 2D surface.">DCEL</a> data structure is defined as the line segment between two vertices in the polygon. It is represented by two <a class="el" href="class_half_edge.html" title="Represents a directed edge in a polygon.">HalfEdge</a> objects, with one <a class="el" href="class_half_edge.html" title="Represents a directed edge in a polygon.">HalfEdge</a> representing each directed end of the edge. The pair of <a class="el" href="class_half_edge.html" title="Represents a directed edge in a polygon.">HalfEdge</a> objects are stored as a pair in the edge member variable of the <a class="el" href="class_edge.html" title="Represents an edge in the DCEL data structure as a pair of half edges.">Edge</a> class.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
1.3 Face:</h2>
<p>It contains a <a class="el" href="class_half_edge.html" title="Represents a directed edge in a polygon.">HalfEdge</a> pointer pointing to one of the <a class="el" href="class_half_edge.html" title="Represents a directed edge in a polygon.">HalfEdge</a> objects in the <a class="el" href="class_face.html" title="This class represents a Face object in the DCEL data structure.">Face</a>. Additionally, it has an id attribute to uniquely identify each <a class="el" href="class_face.html" title="This class represents a Face object in the DCEL data structure.">Face</a> object.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
2. The Decompose Algorithm:</h1>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_decompose.html" title="Algorithm to decompose a simple polygon into a number of convex polygons.">Decompose</a> class constructor takes a doubly connected edge list (<a class="el" href="class_d_c_e_l.html" title="A data structure that represents a planar subdivision of a 2D surface.">DCEL</a>) as input and initializes the notches vector by calling the <a class="el" href="_utils_8cpp.html#af0e208152de81a50ea2d788ccf79180b" title="Returns a vector of pointers to the Vertex objects that are considered notches within a given Face ob...">getAllNotches()</a> function on the external face of the input polygon. It then initializes the polygon data member and prints out the indices of all the notches in the input polygon.</p>
<p>The primeDecompose() function implements the main <a class="el" href="class_decompose.html" title="Algorithm to decompose a simple polygon into a number of convex polygons.">Decompose</a> algorithm. It first initializes an empty list L, and then adds the first two vertices of the polygon to L. It then iterates over the remaining vertices of the polygon and adds them to L if they form a "convex corner" with the previous two vertices. If the polygon has only one edge, it returns true. If L has two or fewer vertices, it returns false. Otherwise, it repeatedly removes "inessential vertices" from L until L has only three vertices left. An inessential vertex is a vertex that does not affect the monotonicity of the polygon. This is done by creating a rectangle that bounds the current chain of vertices in L, and then checking if any notches are inside the rectangle but outside the chain of vertices. If such a notch is found, the vertex of L that is farthest from the segment connecting the notch to the opposite vertex of the rectangle is removed from L. Finally, if L has more than three vertices, an edge is added from the first to the last vertex of L, and the function returns false.</p>
<p>The merge() function implements the merging algorithm to remove inessential diagonals. It iterates over all the edges that were added to the polygon in the previous step and removes them if they are not "essential" diagonals. Where, An essential diagonal is a diagonal that connects two vertices that form a convex corner with each other. </p>
