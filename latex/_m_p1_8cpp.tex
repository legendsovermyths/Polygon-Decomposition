\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_m_p1}{MP1}} algorithm for polygon triangulation. 

The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_m_p1}{MP1}} algorithm is a variant of the ear-\/clipping method that is used to decompose a polygon into a set of triangles. This algorithm is capable of handling polygons with holes and is useful for a variety of applications in computer graphics and computational geometry. The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_m_p1}{MP1}} algorithm works by finding a sequence of vertices that form a simple polygon, and then removing inessential diagonals until the polygon is completely triangulated.
